1. -------------------------------------
Can we change str[10] to a new value?
Yes, we can as long as that new value is also a char. 
Result: If you change str[10] = 0 the output is 
This is a 0imple C-string
---------------------------------------

2. -------------------------------------
pstr[10] to a new value ?
No, because it's declared as a constant.
result: error: read-only variable is not assignable
---------------------------------------

3. ---------------------------------------
Can we change pstr to a different string ?
Expected: No, because it was declared as a constant. (we were wrong)
result: We can change the entire string, but we can't
change a piece of the existing string
---------------------------------------

4. ---------------------------------------
Can we change str to a different string?
str = some other string' doesn't work.
The error is error: array type 'char [100]' is not assignable

5. ---------------------------------------
If we change pstr to point to a different string: pstr = 'Hello';
What happens to qstr? Will qstr then point to the old
string or the new string?
Expected: qstr will point to the old string
This is a declaration of a pointer to a C-string
Result: Correct!
This is a declaration of a pointer to a C-string
---------------------------------------

6. ---------------------------------------
Can we assign str = 'Goodbye'? Why or why not?
Expected: Yes, we can it wasn't declared as a const.
when we declare an array it will normally be a const.
Result: error: array type char [100] is not assignable
---------------------------------------

7. ---------------------------------------
If we change rstr[5], what happens to str?
Expected: Yes, it's going to change str[5] too.
Result: We were correct!
Z
---------------------------------------

8. ---------------------------------------
If we change str[10], what happens to rstr?
Expected : It will also change.
Result: We were correct! 
This Zs a 0imple C-string
This Zs a Zimple C-string
---------------------------------------

9. ---------------------------------------
What happens if you print pstr, *pstr, or (void *)pstr?
pstr - 
Expected: It's going to print the string: 
Hello
Result: We were right! 
*pstr -:
Expected: The address in memory of the base of the pstr array
Result: T - It gives us the value stored at the start of the array pstr
(void *) pstr
Expected : The address of the pointer Result : 0x10466ef24(Some address)
Result: We were right!
Hello
H
0x1048cab80
